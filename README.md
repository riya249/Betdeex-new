## Project Standard Guidelines

2.All string literals should be written in separate file-name.constant.ts file and  respective variables should be used in components.

3.Use "prop-types" for datatypes while declaring Props 

4.Use Context Api to manage User data with localStorage, so that it can be available on demand from any component
